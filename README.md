![GIHAPON BANNER](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71301838/231173336-807e868c-e34e-4043-b31e-06035e7d6f3e.png)

GIH√ÅPON is a narrative-driven, interactive visual novel game that combines elements of the adventure game genre. With multiple branching paths and endings, players navigate through a fictional Filipino town and interact with characters who exhibit everyday Filipino traits. The game's interactivity is enhanced by the integration of these two genres, allowing players to make choices that impact the progression of the story.

The objective of this research is to create an interactive visual novel-adventure game that features a cohesive non-linear narrative with multiple endings and branching paths determined by the player's choices. The specific goals of this study are as follows:

- Introduce a gameplay element to the visual novel by developing puzzle-solving tasks between story beats, which may include code riddles and item-based puzzles.
- Generate and design a range of dynamic characters with recognizable iconography that align with the game's plot and support the player's progress through the game.
- Use the Game User Experience Satisfaction Scale (GUESS) to assess the final output and determine user satisfaction levels.

**All of the aforementioned goals were effectively executed.**
